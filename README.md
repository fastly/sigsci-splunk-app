# Signal Sciences TA for Splunk App

This app for Splunk connects to the Signal Sciences API in order to pull data into Splunk. 

## Signal Sciences REST API Endpoints used

The latest version **only** supports using API Tokens. 

Information about API Tokens can be found at https://docs.signalsciences.net/developer/using-our-api/

1. https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/api/v0/corps/{{corp}}/sites/{{site}}/analytics/events
2. https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/api/v0/corps/{{corp}}/sites/{{site}}/feed/requests
3. https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/api/v0/corps/{{corp}}/activity


## Where to get API Information?

The Corp name and Dashboard Site names are in the URL for the dashboard. For example if we had a Corp Name of `foo` and a Dashboard Site name of `bar` we would see it like the following:

`https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/corps/{CORP_NAME}/sites/{site_api_name}`

You can also get the API Name for Dashboard Sites from the Manage Sites menu if you are a Corp Owner or Corp Admin. When logging into the Signal Sciences Dashboard you can go to `Corp Tools` -> `Manage Sites` and the lowercase name under the display name is the API Name.

## Indexes

The Technical Adapter does not create an index by default.


## Configuration 1.0.27 or higher

Once the Splunk App has been installed you will need to configure the shared settings and then the Modular Data inputs.

1. Log into your Splunk Web Portal
2. Select the sigsci_TA_for_splunk

3. Click on "Configuration"
4. Click on "Add-on Settings"
5. Fill in the Signal Sciences user (Email Address), Password or API Token, and the Singal Sicences corp name.

   * **Email Address:** This is the username/email address for the Signal Sciences dashboard
   * **API Token:** This is required and should be a token associated with your e-mail address
   * **Corp Name** This is the API id for the corp, often if your Display Name for the corp is "Corp ABC" the API Name might be something like `corp-abc`

10. Fill in the Input settings

    * **Name:** This is the unique name you would like to give the input
    * **index:**  This is the index that will store the data on splunk, you can use `default`
    * **Time Delta in Seconds:** This is the time period, in seconds, that the script will pull. This should generally be left at the default which is 300 and matches the interval for the input.
    * **Interval:** This is the interval frequency the script runs in, in seconds. This should be the same as the delta and is recommended to leave at 300
    * **Site API Name:** This is the API Name for the dashboard it could be something like `app-prod`
